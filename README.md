My group members and I created an inventory management system for bike and ski shops. The project had features like rentals, stock tracking, notification of low stock, customer information for regular customers, etc. For the Individual part of this assignment, the two APIs I decided to implement in the system are the PayPal API which will simulate an e-commerce scenario for purchasing a product, and the second API is Google Street View Image API, which will get/show directions in the application. 

I incorporated the PayPal API in the system's payment page, which will show a payment option through Paypal and guide the user to pay through another option. PayPal is a widespread platform to accept and send payments or even pay on online shopping platforms. Many people use PayPal for payments; thus, by adding the API, I will increase our customer base by providing a more comprehensive range of payment options. This is especially useful when users book rentals or buy products online instead of in-store.

The second API which I incorporated into the system is a Google Street View Image API which will show directions to the rental store to the user so the user can drive to the store based on the google map instructions provided. I used this API on the contacts page, where the press of a button will show the directions to an exemplary store.
